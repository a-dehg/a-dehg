Hello my name is Arshia Dehghan, and I'm an aspiring game dev! I'm currently a student at Texas Tech University expecting to graduate Spring of 2023. I major in Computer Science, and minor in Mathematics and Transmedia Design. 
I love to make art and code games (although I only recently started making games!) I also hate recursion.

At the time of writing this I'm working on a game called 'dogdogdog' on my OpenProcessing page, link below.
After I've finished it, I'm going to learn Unity and learn how to make games using an actual game engine lol.
