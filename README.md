Hello my name is Arshia Dehghan, and I'm an aspiring software engineer! I'm currently an undergrad student at Texas Tech University expecting to graduate December of 2023. I major in Computer Science, and minor in Mathematics and Transmedia Design. 
I love to solve programming problems and learning new things from programming practice! I spend a lot of time on Leetcode and learn new concepts and ways of solving problems. I enjoy reinforcing my software engineering knowledge by trying out tough problems, and seeing where I could've improved.

Hobby wise I like to make art and program video games, some point after I finish my current research project with a professor and learn more HTML/Javascript/CSS, I will put all my art and works on a website that I've made.
